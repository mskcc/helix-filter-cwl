CWL files and workflows to accompany the [helix_filters_01](https://github.com/mskcc/helix_filters_01) repo.

**NOTE:** see the help section under `make help` for the most up to date instructions.

## Test Suite

Development and testing takes place via the test suite.

Make sure that you have copies of the Singularity containers used cached locally

```
make singularity-pull
make singularity-pull-dev
make singularity-pull-facets
```


The included test suite can be run with:

```
make test
```

It typically takes about 45 minutes to run all included tests

- NOTE: tests require data sets that are pre-saved on the `juno` server

### Parallel Test Suite

An extra recipe is included which can run the tests in parallel, for example to run 8 tests at once you can use this command:

```
make test3 -j 8
```

### Single Test

For development purposes, it is helpful to be able to run only a specific test case, or subset of tests.

To do this, first enter an interactive bash session with the environment populated;

```
make bash
```

The run the script with the tests you are interested in, such as;

```
python tests/test_workflow_cwl.py
```

You can further select which test case(s) from the script you wish to run by adding their labels as args;

```
python tests/test_workflow_cwl.py TestClassName

python tests/test_workflow_cwl.py TestClassName.test_function
```
